#The purpose of this code is to learn how to make a directory for my qrcodes
#https://stackabuse.com/creating-and-deleting-directories-with-python/ - a website I used for learning about the os module
#https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html - documentation for the os python module
#https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/os_mkdir.htm - I used this code format for the first code

#https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html
import os

path = "./qrcode_place" #naming the path to be created

os.mkdir(path) #creating the path
